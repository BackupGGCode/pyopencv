pyopencv-2.1.0.wr1.0.2 bug-fix release
--------------------------------------

This bug-fix release mainly introduces 63 std::vector-like classes so
that in the future we can use them with ease. It also divides the very large
pyopencv_free_functions.pypp.cpp file into small files, making it less
painful to compile PyOpenCV. Other than that are usual bug-fixes, 
documentation, and addition of missing features.

- improved the docstrings of a large number of classes and functions
- fixed a small bug in kmeans.py
- added CvSize2D32f for backward compatibility
- improved and fixed a small bug in minMaxLoc()
- improved PyOpenCV to support 64-bit platforms better
- renamed Mat.to_list_of_int32() to Mat.to_list_of_int()
- renamed Mat.from_list_of_int32() to Mat.from_list_of_int()
- changed member variable 'value' of function createTrackbar() from c_int 
  to c_long
- added missing operators for C++ dense data types
- re-written wrapper classes for ndarray and sequence, hoping they would 
  fix a long-standing bug  
- converted class LineIterator into a Python iterator
- converted the wrapped functions of [set/get]TrackbarPos from C-style to 
  C++-style
- introduced function reshapeSingleChannel()

  are split into read_...() and write_...() functions; obsolete cvRead...() 
  and cvWrite...() functions are removed

- improved class FileStorage and removed deprecated class CvFileStorage
- improved class FileNode and removed deprecated class CvFileNode
- removed deprecated C-style functions cvStartReadRawData(), 
  cvGetFileNodeName(), cvOpenFileStorage(), cvGetRootFileNode(), 
  cvGetFileNode(), cvGetFileNodeByName(); use C++-style classes FileStorage 
  and FileNode instead
- removed Size2d, Rectf, and Rectd; they are not available in OpenCV 2.1
- improved ndarray's interface to suppport 64-bit platforms beteter
- split pyopencvext_free_functions.cpp into multiple files

  std::vector< std::vector< cv::Point2i > > is exposed in PyOpenCV as class
  vector_vector_Vec2i
- added a representation string for each std::vector class
- function arguments std::vector<cv::Mat> are now exposed "as is"; function 
  arguments std::vector<cv::MatND> are now exposed "as is"; affected free
  functions are split(), merge(), and mixChannels()

  std::vector classes

pyopencv-2.1.0.wr1.0.1 bug-fix release
--------------------------------------

Mat_<...> classes.

  Index

- added a few classes of cvvidsurv.hpp, fixed a bug in OpenCV's findContours() 
  function, and added contours.py demo

-------------------------------------

- The first release of PyOpenCV. Many fundamentals of OpenCV have been
ported to Python. However, there is still some functionality not fully
available. Lots of small issues need ironing out. Just tell me which
parts you want PyOpenCV to improve and I will take time to improve them.
