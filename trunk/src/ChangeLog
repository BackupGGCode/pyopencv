Change Log
==========

pyopencv-2.0.wr1.1.0 beta release
---------------------------------

This release is backward-incompatible with previous releases. A large number of function arguments and calling sequences have been tweaked. These necessary tweaks would allow PyOpenCV to run slightly more efficiently and to be easier to use.

- added docstrings for a large number of functions
- added code that converts between Mat and external image representations like wx.Bitmap, gtk.pixbuf, PIL.Image
- provided ndarray interface for Size-like classes
- provided converters to convert between cv::Mat and Python list of items
- converted input 1d array arguments into cv::Mat
- added FernClassifier and PlanarObjectDetector classes
- improved calling sequences in classes SURF, MSER, LDetector, and StarDetector
- improved all output function arguments of type std::vector
- improved get_CvMat_ptr() and get_IplImage_ptr()
- lots of buf-fixes

pyopencv-2.0.wr1.0.2 beta release
---------------------------------
- improved snakeImage()
- added 3 new classes: DifferentialImage, IntegralImage, and IntegralHistogram
- removed all the C functions related to CvHistogram. They are deprecated. Use calcHist(), equalizeHist(), compareHist() instead.
- modified CascadeClassifier so that runAt() and setImage() also support old cascades
- fixed a calling sequence of functions knnSearch() and radiusSearch() of class Index
- added ndarray interface to Rect-like classes and the Range class
- improved the behavior of 1d array function arguments
- fixed a bug that could lead to a segfault
- added classes: IndexParams, IndexFactory
- improved SURF, mixChannels() and minMaxLoc()

pyopencv-2.0.wr1.0.1 beta release
---------------------------------

- fixed the demo files according to recent changes
- improved conversion from ndarray to Mat and MatND
- removed from_ndarray() functions
- common std::vectors of primitive data types like 'int', 'float', etc and fixed-size data types like Vec-like, Point-like, Scalar are now represented as ndarrays
- improved contours.py
- added a few classes of cvvidsurv.hpp, fixed a bug in OpenCV's findContours() function, and added contours.py demo
- fixed a bug in getting a temporary pointer to CvMat or IplImage, this patch will incur a complete rebuild if you are building pyopencv from source
- renamed convertPointsHomogeneous functions
- fixed read() and write() functions
- added some more machine-learning classes
- added a few tree-based classes
- added CvDTreeTrainData
- fixed a bug in CvEM
- fixed a bug in CvKNearest
- fixed a bug in CvNormalBayesClassifier
- fixed a bug in CvSVM
- added CvSVM::get_support_vector()
- fixed a bug in CvSVMParams
- fixed a bug in invoking Mat(int, int, int)

pyopencv-2.0.wr1.0.0 pre-beta release
-------------------------------------

- The first release of PyOpenCV. Many fundamentals of OpenCV have been
ported to Python. However, there is still some functionality not fully
available. Lots of small issues need ironing out. Just tell me which
parts you want PyOpenCV to improve and I will take time to improve them.
